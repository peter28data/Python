# Web Analytics ROI Optimization – Data Insights Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user web engagement data to identify opportunities for increasing conversions and maximizing marketing ROI. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page views, click-through rates, and purchase behavior were evaluated to provide actionable recommendations that improve the customer journey and business outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Help marketing and product teams:
- Reduce drop-off between engagement and conversion
- Improve landing page performance
- Prioritize content that drives high-value actions (purchases)

## 📊 Key Insights Summary

### 1️⃣ Users are engaging but not converting at the same rate
![Page Views](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/page_views.png)
- Average **Time on Page** and **Page Views per User** show healthy interest
- But **Conversion Rate** remains significantly lower than expected

  ↳ A focused review of friction points during checkout is necessary 

### 2️⃣ Mobile traffic is high — but cost-inefficient
![Devices](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/device_performance.png)
- **Mobile users generate ~60% of sessions**
- Yet **Desktop users drive a higher percentage of purchases**
- Digital ad spend is currently overweighted toward mobile
  
  ↳ Shift budget to desktop campaigns to improve ROI

### 3️⃣ Returning Customers provide disproportionate revenue
![Funnel](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/funnel.png)
- Returning visitors show higher **Add-to-Cart Rate**, **AOV**, and **Final Conversions**
- Current experience doesn’t reward loyalty
  
  ↳ Implement retention strategies (e.g., free shipping, loyalty promos)
