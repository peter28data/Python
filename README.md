# 📌Web Analytics ROI Optimization 
# 🧪Exploratory Data Analysis Project

##  Overview

1. This project focuses on analyzing user **web-engagement data** to identify opportunities for increasing conversions and maximizing marketing ROI. 

2. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **page views, click-through rates, and purchase behavior** were evaluated to provide actionable recommendations that improve the customer journey.

---
## 1️⃣ This Histogram is from the Python code below:

![Page Views](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/page_views.png)

---
📌 Lines 5-8 are Imported Libraries that allow for graphs to be generated inside of Python.

📌 Lines 11-16 are NumPy library code to generate Mock Data in the graphs.

🎯 Business Objective
Help marketing and product teams:
- Improve landing page performance
- Prioritize content that drives high-value actions (purchases)

---

## 2️⃣ This Line Chart is labeled as "Conversion Funnel" in the Python code below:

## 3️⃣ This Barplot is labeled as "Device Conversion Comparison" in the Python code Above:

## 📊 Key Insights Summary
###  Users are engaging but not converting at the same rate
- Average **Time on Page** and **Page Views per User** show healthy interest
- But **Conversion Rate** remains significantly lower than expected

  ↳ A focused review of friction points during checkout is necessary 

---

### 📊 Returning Customers provide disproportionate revenue
- Returning visitors show higher **Add-to-Cart Rate**, **AOV**, and **Final Conversions**
- Current experience doesn’t reward loyalty
  
  ↳ Implement retention strategies (e.g., free shipping, loyalty promos)

---

### 📊 Mobile users generate ~60% of sessions
- Yet **Desktop users drive a higher percentage of purchases**
- Digital ad spend is currently overweighted toward mobile
  
  ↳ Shift budget to desktop campaigns to improve ROI

## 🧪 Methodology
| Area | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Mock Data | NumPy Library, Matplotlib Visuals, Seaborn for Categorical plot |
| Analysis | Funnel evaluation, Segmentation (device & visitor type) |
| KPIs | CTR, Conversion %, Bounce %, Customer Value Contribution |

---

Tools used:
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Histogram
- Barplot
- Line Chart

However:

In real-world datasets, the code below utilizes one of many cleaning techniques to begin the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process.

For now, a snippet is shown below to remove duplicated data often found in real-world data.

🧪 The code below utilized **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find the **Summary Statistics** of **the 'clicks' feature** from the dataset. 

1. Variables such as average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were produced from the Line 20 of code.

2. Lines 24-36 of code manages outliers in the 'clicks' feature.

## 🚀 Recommendations
| Action | Expected Impact |
|--------|----------------|
| Improve checkout usability | +10–15% conversion lift |
| Reallocate ad spend to desktop-dominant channels | Better CPA / ROAS |
| Launch loyalty perk for returning visitors | Higher repeat revenue |
