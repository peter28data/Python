# 📊 Web Analytics ROI Optimization 
# 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis - Python Project

##  Executive Summary

This project demonstrates data analysis using python to generate mock data, build graphs, and explore the data for statistics such as standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. 

1. This project focuses on analyzing user **web-engagement data** to identify opportunities for increasing conversions and maximizing marketing ROI. 

2. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **page views, click-through rates, and purchase behavior** were evaluated to provide actionable recommendations that improve the customer journey.

---
📌 Lines 5-8 are Imported Libraries that allow for graphs to be generated inside of Python.

📌 Lines 11-16 are NumPy library code to generate Mock Data in the graphs.

🎯 Business Objective
Help marketing and product teams:
- Improve landing page performance
- Prioritize content that drives high-value actions (purchases)

---

## 📊 Key Insights Summary
###  Users are engaging but not converting at the same rate
- Average **Time on Page** and **Page Views per User** show healthy interest
- But **Conversion Rate** remains significantly lower than expected

  ↳ A focused review of friction points during checkout is necessary 

---

### 📊 Returning Customers provide disproportionate revenue
- Returning visitors show higher **Add-to-Cart Rate**, **AOV**, and **Final Conversions**
- Current experience doesn’t reward loyalty
  
  ↳ Implement retention strategies (e.g., free shipping, loyalty promos)

---

### 📊 Mobile users generate ~60% of sessions
- Yet **Desktop users drive a higher percentage of purchases**
- Digital ad spend is currently overweighted toward mobile
  
  ↳ Shift budget to desktop campaigns to improve ROI

## 🧪 Methodology
| Area | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Mock Data | NumPy Library, Matplotlib Visuals, Seaborn for Categorical plot |
| Analysis | Funnel evaluation, Segmentation (device & visitor type) |
| KPIs | CTR, Conversion %, Bounce %, Customer Value Contribution |

---

Tools used:
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Histogram
- Barplot
- Line Chart

However:

In real-world datasets, the code below utilizes one of many cleaning techniques to begin the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process.

For now, a snippet is shown below to remove duplicated data often found in real-world data.

🧪 The code below utilized **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find the **Summary Statistics** of **the 'clicks' feature** from the dataset. 

1. Variables such as average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were produced from the Line 20 of code.

2. Lines 24-36 of code manages outliers in the 'clicks' feature.

## 🚀 Recommendations
| Action | Expected Impact |
|--------|----------------|
| Improve checkout usability | +10–15% conversion lift |
| Reallocate ad spend to desktop-dominant channels | Better CPA / ROAS |
| Launch loyalty perk for returning visitors | Higher repeat revenue |
