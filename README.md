# 📌Web Analytics ROI Optimization – Data Insights Project

##  Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user web engagement data to identify opportunities for increasing conversions and maximizing marketing ROI. 

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page views, click-through rates, and purchase behavior were evaluated to provide actionable recommendations that improve the customer journey.

Help marketing and product teams:
- Improve landing page performance
- Prioritize content that drives high-value actions (purchases)

## 📊 Key Insights Summary
###  Users are engaging but not converting at the same rate
- Average **Time on Page** and **Page Views per User** show healthy interest
- But **Conversion Rate** remains significantly lower than expected

  ↳ A focused review of friction points during checkout is necessary 

### 2️⃣ Mobile traffic is high — but cost-inefficient
![Devices](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/device_performance.png)
- **Mobile users generate ~60% of sessions**
- Yet **Desktop users drive a higher percentage of purchases**
- Digital ad spend is currently overweighted toward mobile
  
  ↳ Shift budget to desktop campaigns to improve ROI

### 3️⃣ Returning Customers provide disproportionate revenue
![Funnel](https://github.com/peter28data/python1/blob/main/funnel.png)
- Returning visitors show higher **Add-to-Cart Rate**, **AOV**, and **Final Conversions**
- Current experience doesn’t reward loyalty
  
  ↳ Implement retention strategies (e.g., free shipping, loyalty promos)

The code above utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to find the summary statistics of the 'clicks' feature from the dataset. Variable such as average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were necessary to produce the histogram and other visuals here. 

The code below removes duplicate data to begin the EDA process.
